            <p>"Whether you are doing something interesting or not, we would advise you to stop. Take a few seconds to breathe and dive into Big Man, the new song from 22-year-old singer Sara Abraham.  Indeed, in a time when everything goes fast, when many don't take the time to appreciate beautiful things, allowing yourself this musical break is one of the best things you can do today. Thanks to a voice enrolled in a soft sensitivity that transports you, Sara Abraham leaves you no choice. She grabs you, captivates you, engages you in a delicate veil of beautiful things. Relentless melodies, a musicality that transpires from the first bars, a production of great quality in short, Sara Abraham delivers a little addiction to you, a song that we listen to again and again, that we never tire of."</p>

            <p>"Big Man has a calming and pleasant sound which also shows that there has been lots of excitement as well as complexity in its creation process. The track combines a classic setup. The bass is coordinated with the drums in the rhythm section nicely while it is worthwhile to mention that the song contains both piano and a jazz guitar that compliment each other splendidly. [...]</p>
            <p>To me, Abrahamâ€™s voice is meant to soften you, to help you back off a little, gather your thoughts and unsharp any moodiness you might have (I know this is not a proper expression but you get the point, no?). The interesting bit is that she manages this while avoiding the traps of becoming corny. And if she can do this, then I suppose there are only great thing to await from that young woman creator."</p>
