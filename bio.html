        <p>Sara Abraham is a Cypriot singer-songwriter currently based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. At the age of 9, Sara began taking violin lessons until the age of 12, when she moved on to study classical guitar and piano. After graduating from high school, Sara moved to the Netherlands to study songwriting, at Codarts Rotterdam. 

        <p> On 2 June 2020, she released her first single recorded in a studio in The Hague - a pop-bossa nova feel track titled 'Big Man'. Later, in October of 2020, came her second single release, ‘Kehrimbari', which translates to “amber” in Greek. Sara decidated this first Greek song to her grandmother. A month later she released a music video for “Kehrimbari”, that was shot in Cyprus in specific locations that, to her, resembled home and finding peace.</p>
        
        <p> ‘Kehrimbari’ was selected to be performed for the opening of the upcoming ‘Grandmother film festival” in Rotterdam, December 2021. Following her graduation from the conservatory in August 2021, Sara remains based in Rotterdam, working on new compositions and projects to be showcased in the summer of 2022. </p>
